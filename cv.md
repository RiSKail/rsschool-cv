# About me

I've been interested in programming since I was 14. Every day I try to develop in this direction. In my spare time, I am fond of music. At the moment, my main priority is to work in an IT company to understand the whole essence of working in a team. I plan to become a JavaScript Middle Developer in a couple of years. Calm, kind, cheerful, easy to join any team. I quickly learn something new in practice.
